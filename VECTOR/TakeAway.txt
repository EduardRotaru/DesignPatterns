Structural design patterns

All about getting the interface you want from the interface you have 
Simple representation 
	Power adaptors have different power (interface) requirements
		Voltage (5V, 220V)
		Socket/plug type(Europe UK USA)
We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface
Thus we use a special device(adapter) to give us interface we require from the interface we have
Adapter: A construct which adapts an existing interface X to comfort to the required interface Y

Summary:
Determine the API you have and the API you need
Create a component which aggregates(has a reference to, ..) the adaptee
Intermediate represensations can pile up: use caching and other optimization like cleaning up the memory when its no longer required
