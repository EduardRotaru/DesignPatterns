Facade pronounced as fasade
Exposing several components through a single interface

Motivation:
Balancing complexity and presensation/usability
Typical home
	Many subsystems
	Complex internal structure	
	End user is not exposed to internals
Same with software
	Many systems working to provide flexibility but..
	API consumers want it to just work

Provides a simple easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code

Summary:
To provide a simplified API over a set of classes or bigger subsystems, no matter how I scale it
May wish to expose internally though the facade
May allow users to escalate to more complex APIs if they need to
