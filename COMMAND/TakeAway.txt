Motivation
Ordinary C# stateents are perishable
	Cannot undo a field/property assignment
	Cannot directly serialize a sequence of actions (calls)
Want an object that represents an operation
	X should change its property Y to Z
	X should do W()
Uses: GUI commands, multi-level undo/redo macro recording and more
Command: Lets you build an object which represents an instruction to perform a particular action
	Contains all the information is necessary for the action to be taken.

Summary:
	We take an operation an encapsulate this operation in a separate object, we can serialize or store in the memory and we can roll back
	Define instructions for applying the command (either in the command itself, elsewhere)
	Optionally we can define instructions for undoing the command
	Can create composite commands aka macros
