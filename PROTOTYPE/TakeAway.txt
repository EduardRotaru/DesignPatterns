-- Its all about object copying 

Motivation
-- Complicated objects are not designed from scratch
	-- They reiterate existing designs
-- An existing partially or fully constructed design is a Prototype
-- We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
	-- Requires a deep copy support
-- We make the cloning convinient (via a factory)
Prototype - A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of

Summary
To implement a prototype, partially construct an object and store it somewhere
Clone the prototype 
	Implement your own deep copy functionality; or
	Serialize and deserialize - They traverse the entire object graph
		Customize the resulting instance
