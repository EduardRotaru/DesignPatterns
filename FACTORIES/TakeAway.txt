Overview
-- Object creation gets too convoluted
-- Constructor is not descriptive
	-- Name mandated by name of containing type
	-- Cannot overload the constructor with the same set of arguments with different names
	-- Can turn into optional paramter hell, meaning adding a lot of optional paramters to the constructor, because confusing and tedious
Object creation (not piece-wise like Builder) can be outsourced to	
	-- A separate function Factory Method
	-- That may exists in a separate class Factory
	-- Can create hierarchy of factory with Abstract Factory

Factory - A component responsible solely for wholesale(not piece-wise) creation of objects.

Summary 
-- Factory Method - A factory method is a static method that creates objects, it has certain advantages instead of making a simple constructor
-- A factory can take care of object creation 
-- A factory can be external or reside inside the object as an inner class
-- Hierarchies of factories can be used to create related objects
