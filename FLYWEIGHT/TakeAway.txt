Goal
Space optimization

Motivation
Avoid redundacy when storing data
E.g MMORPG
	- Plenty of users with identical names
	- No sense in storing same names over and over again
	- Store a list of names and pointers to them (references, indexes)
.Net performs string interning, so an indetical string is stored only once
E.g bold or italic text in console
	Dont want each character to have a formatting character
	Operate on ranges(line number, start/end position)

Flyweight a space optimization tehcnique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects.
	- avoid duplication of data, database optimization approach

Summary:
If you have any data which is common then you try to store the data externally then you try to minimze the data you store
	In the case of strings you can define the idea of ranges on homogenous collections and store data related to those ranges 
		If you have a collection of elements and you want to change a certain part of these elements in a particular way you define a range
			.NET string interning is the Flyweight pattern
