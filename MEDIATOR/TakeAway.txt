Facilitates communication between components by letting the components be unaware of each other absence or presence in the system
Components go in and out of a system at any time
	- Chat room participants
	- players in a MMORPF
It makes no sense for them to have direct references to one another
	Those references may go dead
Solution: have then all refer to some central component that facilitates communication

Mediator
A componentat that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarily being aware of each other or having direct reference access to each other

Summary:
Create the mediator and have each object in the system refer to it
e.g in a field
Mediator engages in bidirectional communication with its connected components
Meditator has functions the components can call
Components have functions the mediator can call
Even processing(e.g Rx) libraries make communication easier to implement
